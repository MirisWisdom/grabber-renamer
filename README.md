# About
This is one of my smaller projects...

It is used in conjunction with ![Grabber](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lap00zza/Grabber).
Grabber is used to download streams from 9Anime, and Renamer is used to parse the generated `metadata.json`.
It will rename the downloaded episodes to their real names, e.g: `bVTiwZTHZS2Lmme.mp4` to `some_delightful_episode-ep_001-standard.mp4`.

# Usage
> NOTE: It is assumed you have already downloaded videos using the ![Grabber](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lap00zza/Grabber) add-on.
Check out its ![README](https://github.com/lap00zza/Grabber/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on how to use it!

1. Select the `metadata.json` file which Grabber generated.
2. Select the folder where the episodes have been downloaded.
3. Click on the `Rename Episode Files` button, and you're done!

# Requirements
- Lap00zza's ![Grabber](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lap00zza/Grabber)
